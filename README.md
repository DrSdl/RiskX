Pyhton and Mathematica scripts for my lectures on risk, uncertainty and volatility

Power generation used to be a boring industry: vertically integrated companies, a reliable business model and stable political boundary conditions. All this has evaporated in 2017. Today energy business and especially electricity generation is a very good example of what risk, uncertainty and volatility can mean in practice.

Questions of risk, uncertainty and volatility have been most thoroughly studied in the financial markets. They are an everyday companion in the trading of bonds, stocks and derivatives. But the volatility of these assets is benign compared to what can happen in the energy and commodity markets. There must be much more model improvements to better describe them. Nevertheless, the mathematical foundations in the form of stochastic differential equations will not change. These lectures take a deep dive into these formalisms – and it is also the reason why it is easy to lecture them for a physicist: many of these methods have their origin in quantum mechanics and quantum statistics.
